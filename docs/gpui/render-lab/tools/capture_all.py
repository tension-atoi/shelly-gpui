"""Batch capture harness for all 46 canonical fixtures in RENDER-01.

Ensures determinism by:
1. Freezing the clock at t = 0.500s
2. Selecting each fixture via the canonical socket control protocol
3. Capturing back-to-back frames with grim
4. Locating the fiducial magenta marker bounding box
5. Comparing normalized decoded RGBA buffers for bit-exact identity
6. Emitting .roi.png, .manifest.json, and a consolidated EVIDENCE_INDEX.json
